# Python-Course
You can Learn Python from scratch to expert level.

# Open source:
Python is publicly available open source software, any one can use source code that doesn't cost anything.

# Easy-to-learn: 
Popular (scripting/extension) language, clear and easy syntax, no type declarations, automatic memory management, high-level data types and operations, design to read (more English like syntax) and write (shorter code compared to C, C++, and Java) fast.

# High-level Language:
High-level language (closer to human) refers to the higher level of concept from machine language (for example assembly languages). Python is an example of a high-level language like C, C++, Perl, and Java with low-level optimization.

# Portable:
High level languages are portable, which means they are able to run across all major hardware and software platforms with few or no change in source code. Python is portable and can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris, FreeBSD, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400 and many more.

# Object-Oriented: 
Python is a full-featured object-oriented programming language, with features such as classes, inheritance, objects, and overloading.

# Python is Interactive :
Python has an interactive console where you get a Python prompt (command line) and interact with the interpreter directly to write and test your programs. This is useful for mathematical programming.

# Interpreted : 
Python programs are interpreted, takes source code as input, and then compiles (to portable byte-code) each statement and executes it immediately. No need to compiling or linking

# Extendable : 
Python is often referred to as a "glue" language, meaning that it is capable to work in mixed-language environment. The Python interpreter is easily extended and can add a new built-in function or modules written in C/C++/Java code.

# Libraries : 
Databases, web services, networking, numerical packages, graphical user interfaces, 3D graphics, others.

## Supports :
Support from online Python community
